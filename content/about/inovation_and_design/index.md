# AWARD FOR BEST

## INNOVATION & DESIGN

The Innovation Award honours the most creative and innovative designs in the field of participants. Every year the waterbikers put great effort into rethinking and reevaluating their designs in order to sustain competitiveness. Some teams bring new boats, some teams conduct finetuning or fundamental redesigns on existing boats.

Every Team may compete with one design only. The competition awards the best new design or improvement to existing design. Please turn in one page A4 with a description of the innovation until April 30, 2023 to
[IWR2023(at)strak-kiel.de](mailto:IWR2023@strak-kiel.de?subject=Innovation%20Award "Mail Address"). Additionally you may turn in photos, drawings, sketches or test results. Make sure that all documents are .pdf files. The Winner will be announced on Saturday, the 27st of May during the last lunch at the IWR2023.
