Welcome to the iwr website 2023. Sorry for the delay but now it is here. Here we will provide you besides the mail with current information regarding the iwr. 

The iwr will take place this year in the Baltic Sea. Therefore there is a bilge pump duty for open hulls this year for safety reasons! In addition, it is recommended for boats that do not have a large freeboard to increase it a little. In addition, we had to increase the participation fee to 120â‚¬ due to inflation. We regret this step very much but unfortunately we had no other choice. 

Nevertheless we are looking forward to welcoming you in Kiel for this year's Iwr.
Your Iwr organization team
