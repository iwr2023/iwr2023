Welcome to the iwr website 2023. Sorry for the delay, but it's here now. Here we will provide you with the latest information about the iwr in addition to the mail.

This year the iwr will take place in the Baltic Sea. Therefore, this year it is allowed to install an electric bilge pump for safety reasons! In addition, buoyancy bodies have to be integrated into the boat or it has to be proven that the boat floats when it is full. Furthermore, for boats that do not have a large freeboard, it is recommended to increase it slightly. We also had to increase the entry fee to 120â‚¬ due to inflation. We regret this step very much, but unfortunately we had no other choice.

Nevertheless, we look forward to welcoming you in Kiel for this year's Iwr. Your Iwr organizing team
