# Dear Waterbikers,

We have good news, the registration is finally open; our Plan is to make this the best IWR ever. We already have a great area with an old Shipbuilding Hall in which both the Party area and the Pitlane will be located. Still, we also need your help to spread the word and mobilize as many participants as possible. Together we will make this an unforgettable Event.
The deadline is 31.03.23. We will also offer a late registration until 15.04.23 without the Goodie bag and T-shirt.
A Ticket for the full IWR will be 120€, and the Weekend Ticket (Friday 14AM-Sunday) will be 80€. We will also offer Day Tickets for 20€, which can be purchased on the same day in Kiel. Day Tickets will only include beverages and access to the premises but no food.
Payment for the Participants will be due on 07.04.23 and 21.04.23, respectively. You will receive the Payment Information after the submittal of the registration. Please also send every Participant in your Team the Liability exclusion.

We will offer parking spaces for car camping. We will also guarantee everybody a place for their tent, but because it’s an old shipyard, grass areas for camping are limited in space. Grass will be considered a request only, and actual camping space will be assigned based on availability.
The Pitlane is also in an old Shipbuilding Hall and will offer enough space for every Team. The Roof has some holes, but we will ask the German Teams to bring their Tents which should be enough to give everybody a dry space.
While the official start will be Wednesday, 24.05.23, we will provide fenced Parking spaces for the Boats and trailers from 21.05.23 to 29.05.23.
This will also be the first Vegetarian only IWR. All teams that cannot do without meat may bring their own grill and meat.
The regatta takes place at the shipyard in operation. The behavior should be adapted to this, and up-to-date tetanus vaccination is recommended. We will do our best to remove all dangerous parts, but we cannot guarantee 100% that all rusty parts will be removed. Sturdy shoes are, therefore, a must-have.
We will also need the number of Boats and a Photo and Fact sheet for each Boat by 31.03.23.
Until 30.04.23, we will also need proof of the liability insurance for each of your boats.
